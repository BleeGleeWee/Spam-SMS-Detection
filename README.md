# 📩 SMS Spam Detection ML Project

## 📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build and deploy a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham** (Not Spam).  
The model is trained using a labeled dataset and deployed for real-world testing.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas, Numpy
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Streamlit (for deployment) *(if you're using deployment tutorial)*
- Heroku / Render *(optional for web deployment)*

---

## 📚 Dataset
- **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
- **Description**: 5,500 SMS messages labeled as Spam or Ham.
